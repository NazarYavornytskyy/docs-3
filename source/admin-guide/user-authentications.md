# User Authentication Introduction

Using the Gluu Server's interception script infrastructure, you can define the business logic for complex multi-step authentication workflows, providing SSO for people using smart cards, tokens, mobile or biometric authentication mechanisms. You don't have to chose one multi-factor authentication technology. You can have multiple authentication mechanisms active at the same time--Web or mobile clients can request a certain authentication type by using standard OpenID Connect request parameters.

Sophisticated authentication logic can implement adaptive authentication. For example, you can add extra authentication steps based on contextual information such as fraud scores, location, or browser profiling. You can also customize the look and feel of a web authentication: html, css, images and javascript can be externalized and managed by your organization.

A number of multi-factor authentication scripts are shipped in the Gluu Server by default, including support for FIDO U2F tokens (like Vasco and Yubikey), Gluu's free mobile two-factor application [Super Gluu](https://super.gluu.org), social authentication via Passport.js, certificate authentication, and Duo Security. 

!!! Note
    If you run into issues while configuring or testing authentication mechanisms, e.g. not able to login or facing error pages, please         follow the [FAQ recommendations](./faq.md) to troubleshoot. Make sure to perform tests in an incognito tab or a different browser       to avoid session issues.
