# SAML
## Outbound SAML
Outbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) or traditional SAML. In an outbound SAML transaction the SP redirects the user to the designated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. The IDP will ask for user's credentials and upon successful authentication, the user is sent back to the SP logged in. 

In order for this transaction to happen successfully there must be pre-established trust between the IDP and the SP. In the Gluu Server, the IDPs SSO configuration is called a Trust Relationship (TR). The following sections cover how to create a TR in the Gluu Server. 

!!! Note
    For any SAML transaction, a trust relationship must be created in the IDP.

### Trust Relationship Requirements     
Each Trust Relationship requires the infomation listed below.

**Metadata of the SP**       
Metadata is an XML file which has configuration data used to establish trust between the website (SP) or IDP (Gluu Server). Websites (SP) can provide metadata via a URL or as a separate file. Metadata can change, so a static URL typically requires the least amount of ongoing maintenance. 
  
**Required Attributes**      
Each SP may require one or many attributes in order to grant a user access. Required attributes vary depending on the application, and should be explicitly listed in the application's documentation. The Gluu Server ships with certain preconfigured attributes and also supports the creation of custom attributes. Once the attributes are available in the Gluu Server, the administrator only needs to click on the desired attribute(s) and it will be released to the SP upon successful user authentication.

**SSO Testing Endpoint**       
Every website (SP) should have both a staging and a production URI
endpoint which can be checked for SSO.

### Create a Trust Relationship in the Gluu Server       
* Go to SAML → Trust Relationships
* Click on “Add Relationship”

![addTR](../img/saml/addTR.png)

* A new page will appear. Here, as a Gluu Server administrator you need
  to provide all the required information regarding the SP to create a Trust
  Relationship from Gluu Server.

![newTR](../img/saml/newTR.png)

* _Display Name_: Name of the Trust Relationship (it should be unique for every trust relationship)     
* _Description_: Little description. Purpose and SSO link can be added here.    
* _Metadata Type_: There are four available options to choose from in Gluu Server. The correct type depends on how the SP is delivering the Metadata to your IDP.      
    * _File_: If SP has uploadable metadata in XML format, this option works best.
    * _URI_: If the metadata of SP has URI link and accessible from the internet, Gluu Server Administrator can use this option.
    * _Generate_: If the SP is an "inhouse application" or the “Shibboleth SP” is installed or going to be installed in target application site (SP) the generate option will generate a how-to guide for installing the Shibboleth SP on the application. will help user to configure and install Shibboleth SP on their own area. Please note the following if you do plan to use the Generate method for your SP:
            * _URL_ : This is the `hostname of SP`    
            * _Public certificate_ : You must provide the certificate which is a Base64 encoded ASCII file and contain "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----". This certificate can not be password protected.        
            * After creating the Trust Relationship, download the generated configuration files from `Download Shibboleth2 configuration files` link and place these configuration files inside your SP configuration.        
    * _Federation_: If the target application (SP) is affiliated with a federation service (e.g. InCommon, NJEdge etc. ), this option of “Metadata Type” is required. Select “Federation” in Metadata Type and another drop down menu called “Select Federation” will appear. From this drop menu select desired Federation. After selecting the “Federation Name”, a new link named “Click to select
entity id” will appear. From this link the Gluu Server Administrator can select all SP entityIDs which are affiliated with the federation. Learn how to establish trust with a federation [below](#federation-configuration).     

* _Released_: The SPs required attributes must be added to this pane. The required attributes can be selected from the left side panel with the heading “Release Additional Attributes”.     

The TR is added by clicking on the `Add` button located in the lower left side of the page.     

### Relying Party Configuration     
If the target application does not already support SAML, the Relying Party software must be configured. The relying party configuration is accessible on the TR Creation page. The checkbox `Configure specific Relying Party` must be checked.     

![enable-relying-party.png](../img/saml/enable-relying-party.png)     

The checkbox will result in a link which can be accessed to find information about configuring the relying party for the TR. The image below shows the relying party config panel from which the administrator can add the specific option.     

![tr-relying-party](../img/saml/tr-relying-party.png)     

!!! Note     
    If the target app does not already support a federation standard like SAML, and you or the developer are planning on adding federation to the application, we strongly recommend using OpenID Connect rather than SAML. OpenID Connect is newer, easier to use, and follows modern best practices. Learn more in our blog: [OAuth vs. SAML vs. OpenID Connect](http://gluu.co/oauth-saml-openid).
    
### Federation Configuration     
If the SP is part of an identity federation such as InCommon, the administrator must add the federation as an SP in the Gluu Server. This will enable the administrator to more easily create TRs with SPs in the federation. The example below shows how an administrator would add a TR for the InCommon Federation.

![federationTR](../img/saml/federationTR.png)

Once a TR has been established with the federation, the Gluu Server administrator can easily create TRs with any SP included in the federation by selecting the federation from the `Federation Name` drop down menu and selecting the entity-id for the SP.

![federation-entityid.png](../img/saml/federation-entityid.png)

## Inbound SAML     
Gluu Server uses an open source product called Asimba to achieve inbound SAML. Asimba allows websites to use a single IDP for SSO even when the organization has multiple trusted IDPs. Please see the [Asimba website](http://www.asimba.org/site/) for more information.

Gluu Server is shipped with the SAML Script which simplifies the process of using SAML Proxy. The SAML proxy configuration is made easy from the oxTrust admin interface. This section provides a step-by-step method of configuring the proxy with two (2) IDPs and a single SP. The administrator can add multiple IDPs or SPs if required using the same method. However, it is mandatory that all the SPs and IDPs are connected to the Asimba server, or the IDP that has the Asimba module enabled.

### Trust Relationship      
**Note: The configuration below is done in the Gluu Server 
with Asimba installed with the hostname `https://test.gluu.org`.**

Create Trust relationships for all service provides which are included in SAML Proxy SSO workflow. In our test setup we created Trust relationship for remote SP which has entityID 'https://sp.gluu.org/shibboleth'. How to create Trust Relationship is available in [Section 2.1](#2.1-outbound-saml).

Log into the oxTrust inteface and follow the steps to add a new Trust Relationship.

  - Gluu Server's Asimba metadata can be achieved from 'https://test.gluu.org/asimba/profiles/saml2'
    - Download the metadata and use 'File' method to create Trust relationship
  - Relying Party Configuration: 'SAML2SSO' Profile

        - `nameIDFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress"`
     - How to create nameID in Gluu Server is available [here](https://gluu.org/docs/customize/attributes/#custom-nameid)

### Test Asimba with SAML Proxy
Here is a quick video on how SAML Proxy SSO might look like. Here in this video we are using 'https://sp.gluu.org/protected/print.py' as our protected service provider link. After initiating the SSO, we are moved to Gluu Server's SAML Proxy discovery page ( https://test.gluu.org ). From there we selected 'Nest' as our desired authentication server. After succesful authentication we are landing to proctected resource.
