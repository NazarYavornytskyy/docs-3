# oxTrust Administrative Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The administration interface (oxTrust) is accessible from the `hostname` provided during setup. After installation is complete, log in to the web-based interface with the username `admin` and the `LDAP superuser` password. 

## Welcome Page
After successful authentication the administrator is taken to the Gluu Server admin dashboard. Some basic information about the VM/server is displayed as well as the server version, free memory, and disk space. In the top right there is a user icon which can be used to log out of the Gluu Server as well as navigate to the user-profile. 

![welcome-page.png](../img/oxtrust/welcome-page.png "Welcome to Gluu Server")

The left hand menu is used to navigate the admin interface. The menu includes links to manage SAML, OpenID Connect and UMA integrations, as well as server configurations, users, and your own personal profile. 

## Configuration
![configuration-menu](../img/oxtrust/configuration-menu.png "Organization Menu")

The configuration tab contains tools to configure the Gluu Server. This section is dedicated to tuning and tinkering your Gluu Server. Upon clicking the configuration menu item, multiple subsections are revealed. The administrator can manage authentication, registration, attributes, LDAP synchronization, logs, and more from this menu. Each page is described in detail below. 

### Organization Configuration
There are three sections in the organization configuration page:       

(1). [System Configuration](#system-configuration)       
(2). [SMTP Server Configuration](#smtp-server-configuration)

![organization-config-head](../img/oxtrust/organization-config-head.png "Organization Configuration")

**System Configuration**      
The System Configuration tab includes options to enable and manage system configuration options. Each field is described below:

- Self-service password reset: Allow users to reset their password via email. In order for this feature to work, the admin will also need to have the [SMTP Server Configuration](#smtp-server-configuration) section completed.      

- SCIM Support: Enable SCIM if you plan on using SCIM to move identity data between applications.      

- DNS Server(s): If the organization uses any custom `DNS Server(s)`, the address should be updated here. 

- Maximum Log Size (MB): by default the maximum size of the log file is 200 mb. This value can be increased or decreased depending on the HW specifications and contingency plan of the environment.     

- User can edit their own profile: oxTrust has a profile section for each user. If this option is enabled, users will be able to log into oxTrust and edit the values associated with their user.      

- Contact Email: This email will be displayed on all error pages with a note instructing users to contact for troubleshooting assistance.        

**SMTP Server Configuration**      
The mail server used by the Gluu Server to send notification to the pre-selected email address is configured in this page/panel. All the fields in this page are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation. The fields are self-explanatory and simple such as hostname, user, password, ssl-requirement, authentication requirement, sending name and address.

**OxTrust Settings**      
Some basic information abouht the administrator interface is available in this page. The administrator can find out the oxTrust build date and number by accessing the oxTrust settings page. The administrator can change the organization name, logo and favicon settings from this page as well. Finally oxTrust Settings page contains the name of the administrator group for Gluu Server. The users added in this group will have administrator access in Gluu Server where they will be able to maintain/configure the server.

### JSON Configuration      
The configuration files are accessible from the administrator interface (oxTrust). 
There are three tabs under the `JSON Configuration` menu

![json-config-head](../img/oxtrust/json-config-head.png "JSON Configuration Headers")

The oxtrust JSON configuration file is accessible from this tab and it can be edited from this page. The changes are updated by clicking on the `Update` button on the bottom of the page. 

The oxAuth JSON configuration page gives easy access to the different endpoints used by Gluu Server CE. This page also contains the supported response, grants and algorithms among other information. The details will follow later on this documentation.

The oxTrust Import Person Configuration page contains the configuration for the file method of importing users into Gluu Server CE. The administrator can import users from a `xls` file which must be defined in this tab to import data in the LDAP attributes. The default format should contain the following fields

### Manage Authentication
The `Manage Authentication` page contains the internal OpenDJ settings for Gluu Server CE. 
The `Default Authentication Method` defines the authentication mechanism used for general 
authentication and oxTrust authentication. The separation is introduced because the users 
logging into Service Providers (SP) do not see the administrative console. 
The `oxTrust authentication mode` decides the authentication mechasims for the users 
logging into the oxTrust admin interface.

![manage-authentication-head](../img/oxtrust/manage-authentication-head.png)

### Manage Custom Scripts
It will not be an understatement to say that the custom script feature makes 
Gluu Server CE so robust and dynamic. The scripts are available for all intents 
and purposes the major being multi-factor authentication. There are many custom scritps 
included with the vanilla Gluu Server CE which can be enabled by clicking the check box. This section is 
discussed in detail under [User Authentication Guide](/admin-guide/user-authentications.md) 

![enable](../img/oxtrust/enable.png)

### Manage Registration
