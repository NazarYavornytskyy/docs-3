#Release Changes

This section of the document will discuss about the changes in the release and its features. 

Gluu Server 3.0.0 has built with few new components which wasn't in its predecessors. With these changes and new components Gluu Server 3.0.0 has significant changes in commands, logs and path to libraries and jar. All these changes will be described in the next few sections.

## New Component Changes in Gluu Server CE 3.0.0

- Tomcat has been replaced with Jetty
- OpenDj is replaced with OpenLDAP
- Upgraded shibboleth IDP has been incorporated ad default outbound SAML service.

## Tomcat Vs Jetty
***Why Jetty over Tomcat as our application server?***

Here are the reason why we switched over to Jetty in place of Tomcat.

### Matches Gluu's container strategy

Jetty matches Gluu's container strategy lot more better than Tomcat, where each app which is incorporated (Identity,oxauth,Asimba, cas,passport, apache,etc) in Gluu can be deployed separately.

By which its gives more leverage to work on each app exclusively and restart the particular app, rather than restarting the whole Gluu Server.

### Manage memory per app

Since we have separated the apps container, it becomes easier to manage memory per app and provide memory as per usage of the app.

### Seperation of Logs

Logs have segregated according to the apps in separate folder and this section has been discussedelaborately under [logs management](../admin-guide/logs.md) section.

### Seperation Network made easy

- oxTrust is internal facing, where admin and admin assigned users and internal users could use the login UI
- oxAuth is internet facing. OxAuth is used by external users and used while multi-factor authentication is used.

### Isolation of Restart

Isolation of restart for individual app is made possible, For Example, Asimba requires more restarts than other apps, and restarting Asimba alone reduces the impact on oxauth. Therefore isolating restart of app doesn't affect other app.

## OpenDj Vs OpenLDAP

OpenLDAP plays a vital role in Gluu Servers, and here are few things which made Gluu to migrate from OpenDJ to OpenLDAP.

1. OpenLDAP has better license
2. Affordable support options from Symas.
3. Proxy Capabilities(Back-Meta)
4. Better crash resistance
5. Less impact on Java Garbage collection.
6. Clear commitment by Symas to open source community.
7. After OpenLDAP LMDB backend recovers quickly and efficiently.

### Proxy Capabilities

The proxy is particularly useful for large deployments.

The 3 parts of the Gluu Server that get big are 

- ou=clients 
- ou=sessions
- ou=people

If we can break these into different ldap server replicated topologies, and use a proxy to route in front. We can increase the write performance of the ldap service.
If you have all the data in one server, it doesn't matter how many servers you add, you are limited in write speed. because all changes are replicated, so it doesn't matter which server receives the original write request, the only way to increase performance is to break up the data and make sure some servers don't see some of the writes.

## New Features
This version of the Gluu Server, includes the following new features to enable more security in SSO.

- Passport.js authentication, this method has been discussed in detail in [Passport](../authn-guide/passport.md) page
- HOTP/TOTP authentication.
- Improved centralized logging for clusters.

## Deploying Jar and Libraries in Jetty
